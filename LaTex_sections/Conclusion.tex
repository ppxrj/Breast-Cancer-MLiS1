\section{Conclusion}
From our findings, Support Vector Machine has the best performance and Decision Tree with least. KNN and Logistic Regression had the same performance with 97.37\% accuracy. Therefore, SVM is the best model to screen cancer. The Decision Tree can be used to find key diagnostic indicators. To improve model accuracy, the SVM needs to be extended to non- linear decision boundaries and consider other methods such as random forest to improve robustness. The test set of 113 samples is small and does not represent the population, so new data is needed to increase the size of the test and training set. Decision trees have clear rule, KNN validates feature quality, logistic regression assigns probabilites to allow doctors make a decision and SVM produces optimal boundaries. If all four models produce the same result, then the accuracy of classification is very high and can be considered accurate.

To conclude, this report shows how supervised machine learning modules can be used to diagnose cancer through rigorous hyper parameter optimisation, model training and clinical awareness to screen breast cancer.
