\section{Introduction}
Breast cancer is one of the most common types of cancer in women. In this report, we use the Wisconsin Breast Cancer database to build a machine learning model to classify whether a tumour is malignant or benign. The database has 30 features with 569 inputs, reporting 357 benign and 212 malignant cells.
