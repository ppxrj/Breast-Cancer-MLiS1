The LaTex report and bibliography is in Latex folder. I've made a separate one for the images to not clutter. 
The notes page is just a log so we know what to do next and what we need to pick up.

# Exam details
## Paper: 
The project description and results will be presented in a 2 page paper in the style of Physical Review Letters, ideally typeset in LaTeX (for example via the RevTeX package) although we will accept other modes of preparation compatible with a two column PRL format and style. 
The paper will have the usual structure (title/authors/affiliations/abstract in the heading section, followed by the main text, figures with appropriate captions, standalone equations, and references). Do not include code in the paper (only pseudo-code if necessary to describe an algorithm).

## Code
All programming will be done in python (version 3). Use of neural network packages (Keras, TensorFlow, etc.) is not allowed; use of other standard packages (numpy, scipy, etc.) is allowed. The code will be submitted,together with the paper. The readability of the code will form part of the assessment. 
(NB:both paper and code will go through plagiarism detection system.)

## Schedule and deadline: 
There are no online workshops after that week to allow time for project work. The deadline for handing in the paper is February 2nd 2026 3pm (submission via Moodle).

Assessment: 60% to the overall mark for the module.

Quality and style of presentation = 50%
Content and understanding = 50%
